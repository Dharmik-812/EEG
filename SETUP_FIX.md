# EEG Project Fix Instructions

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed "process is not defined" Error
- **Problem**: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE` was trying to access Node.js's `process` object in the browser
- **Solution**: Changed to use Vite's `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE`
- **Files Modified**: `src/lib/api.js`, `.env.local`

### 2. ✅ Improved Navbar Design and Functionality
- **Problem**: Navbar was cluttered, had too many sections, and post-login tabs weren't clearly visible
- **Solution**: 
  - Simplified navigation structure with clear separation between public and user-specific links
  - Reduced excessive animations and particles for better performance
  - Made user-specific links (Messages, Groups, Dashboard, etc.) more prominent when logged in
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/Navbar.jsx`

### 3. ✅ Fixed AI Chat Setup & Improved Security
- **Problem**: AI chat wasn't working and API key was exposed to client-side
- **Solution**: 
  - Created dedicated chat API route in the server (`/api/chat`)
  - Moved API key handling to server-side only (removed VITE_ prefix)
  - Centralized API key management in `key.env`
  - Added proper Gemini AI integration to the server
- **Files Modified**: `key.env`, `server/index.js`, `server/package.json`, `.env.local`

## Setup Required

### 1. Get a Google Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key

### 2. Your API Key is Already Configured! ✅
Your Gemini API key is already properly configured in the `key.env` file and is automatically loaded by the server. The key is now:
- ✅ **Server-side only** (never exposed to the browser)
- ✅ **Centrally managed** (one `key.env` file for all API keys)
- ✅ **Secure** (no client-side exposure)

### 3. Install Dependencies and Restart Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Install server dependencies first
cd server
npm install

# Terminal 2 - Start backend server
cd server  
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Start frontend (from root directory)
cd ..
npm run dev
```

## What Should Work Now

1. **Website loads without errors** - No more "process is not defined" error
2. **Cleaner navbar** - Less cluttered, better organized navigation
3. **Post-login navigation** - When logged in, you'll see:
   - Messages tab for user communications
   - Groups tab for group management
   - Dashboard, Leaderboard, Badges, Editor tabs clearly visible
4. **AI Chat functionality** - Once you add the Gemini API key, the chatbot should work

## Testing

1. **Load the website** - Should load without console errors
2. **Login/Register** - Check that user-specific navigation tabs appear
3. **AI Chat** - Navigate to `/chat` and test the AI functionality (requires API key)
4. **Navigation** - All navbar links should work properly

## Notes

- The AI chat requires a valid Google Gemini API key to function
- The navbar is now responsive and less resource-intensive
- User-specific features are now clearly separated and visible when logged in
- The project structure is cleaner and more maintainable
