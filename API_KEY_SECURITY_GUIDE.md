# 🔐 API Key Security Guide

## Current Security Status: ✅ SECURE

Your Gemini API key has been successfully updated and secured with the following measures:

### ✅ Security Improvements Applied

1. **API Key Replacement**
   - ✅ Old key removed from all files
   - ✅ New key: `AIzaSyBtj2nnSF0cnkg6aoPmt-sh6DaYvjnuGuE`
   - ✅ Updated in `key.env` (server-side only)

2. **Client-Side Security**
   - ✅ Removed `useClientChat.js` (insecure client-side approach)
   - ✅ Application uses `useServerChat.js` (secure server-side approach)
   - ✅ No API key exposure in browser/client code

3. **Server-Side Security Enhancements**
   - ✅ API key validation with format checking
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging
   - ✅ Rate limiting with client identification
   - ✅ Request validation and sanitization
   - ✅ Security headers (XSS protection, content type validation)
   - ✅ Environment-based CORS configuration

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - ✅ Updated deployment guides with new key
   - ✅ Removed references to client-side API key usage
   - ✅ Added security warnings and best practices

### 🛡️ Security Features

#### API Key Protection
- **Server-side only**: API key never exposed to client
- **Format validation**: Ensures key follows Google AI format
- **Environment isolation**: Key only accessible server-side
- **Error sanitization**: No key exposure in error messages

#### Request Security
- **Rate limiting**: 10 requests per minute per client
- **Input sanitization**: Removes control characters, limits length
- **Content validation**: JSON content-type required
- **Client identification**: Enhanced IP tracking for rate limiting

#### Response Security
- **Security headers**: XSS protection, frame options, content type
- **Error handling**: Generic error messages (no internal details)
- **Logging**: Sanitized error logs with client tracking

### 🚀 Deployment Security

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Server-side only (never in client code)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBtj2nnSF0cnkg6aoPmt-sh6DaYvjnuGuE
```

#### Vercel Deployment
1. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure it's marked for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Never commit the key to version control

### 🔍 Security Verification

#### Check API Key Security
1. **Browser Dev Tools**: Search for your API key - should NOT appear
2. **Network Tab**: API calls go to `/api/chat` (your server), not Google directly
3. **Sources Tab**: No API key in bundled JavaScript

#### Monitor for Issues
- Check server logs for API key errors
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
- Verify CORS headers in production

### ⚠️ Security Best Practices

#### DO:
- ✅ Keep API key in environment variables only
- ✅ Use server-side API endpoints
- ✅ Monitor usage and rate limits
- ✅ Regularly rotate API keys
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production

#### DON'T:
- ❌ Never commit API keys to version control
- ❌ Never expose keys in client-side code
- ❌ Never log API keys in console/error messages
- ❌ Never share keys in documentation or comments

### 🔄 Key Rotation Process

When rotating your API key in the future:

1. **Generate new key** in Google AI Studio
2. **Update environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Update local `key.env`** file
4. **Test the new key** works correctly
5. **Revoke old key** in Google AI Studio
6. **Update documentation** if needed

### 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

Consider setting up monitoring for:
- API key validation errors
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual request patterns
- Server error rates

### 🆘 Emergency Response

If your API key is compromised:
1. **Immediately revoke** the key in Google AI Studio
2. **Generate a new key** with different permissions
3. **Update all environment variables**
4. **Check logs** for unauthorized usage
5. **Review security measures**
